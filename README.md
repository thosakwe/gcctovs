# gcctovs
Converts GCC errors to Visual Studio-compatible errors.

#Why?
I want to write an operating system. I use Visual Studio to develop, because it is a ridiculously powerful IDE. However, the output errors from my GCC cross-compiler are not compatible with Visual Studio. GCCtoVS is the simple solution to that problem.

#Usage

Syntax: gcctovs input

    * input - The path to a file containing a GCC error, or a GCC error string.

#Installation
You do not have to build anything. The current version is located in the root directory.

#Note
Thank you for using this! Feel free to modify it or report issues as you please.
